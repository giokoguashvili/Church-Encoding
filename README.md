# Church Encoding

ðŸ”¥ Factorial Function as Expression on one line, without mathematical operators, executed with parameter 7

Used Only:
- Lambda Calculus 
- Temrs
- Reduction Operators
- Church Encoding
- and with passed params 7

```js
(n => n(i => i + 1)(0))((f => (x => f(v => x(x)(v)))(x => f(v => x(x)(v))))(f => n => (b => A => B => b(A)(B)())((n => n(x => _ => f => f)(t => _ => t))(n))(_ => f => x => f(x))(_ => (n0 => n1 => n1((n0 => n1 => f => x => n1(f)(n0(f)(x)))(n0))(f => x => x))(n)(f((n => (p => p(t => _ => t) )( n  (p => (x1 => x2 => f => f(x1)(x2))( (p => p(_ => f => f))(p))( (n => f => x => f(n(f)(x)))((p => p(_ => f => f))(p)))) ((x1 => x2 => f => f(x1)(x2))(f => x => x)(f => x => x))))(n)))))(f => x => f(f(f(f(f(f(f(x))))))))) 
// 5040
```

 ðŸ¤¯ Lambca Calculus is Turing Complete, and we can build whole FP & OOP paradigms on it
